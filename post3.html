            <h3> Website update: Added SSL certificate to my website</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Finally, I found the motivation to update my website. It has been bothering me for a long time that when
                I visit my site, the browser warns about an unsecured connection. I had previously done a bit of
                Googling and got the impression that if you want a secure connection, you have to pay for an SSL
                certificate. My friend told me that there are also free certificates available on the internet, so I did
                some more searching. I came across a site called (https://app.zerossl.com/dashboardand) after a bit of
                tinkering, I got a certificate from there. The free certificate is valid for a total of 90 days, so it
                needs to be updated fairly often. If others are interested in a free SSL certificate and/or validating
                one for their internet service, here’s how it can be done through the zerossl site:

            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>1. Go to zerossl.com.Add your domain to the search field and click next step:
                <br>
                <br>

                <img src="sslcertpicture1.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                    width="500" height="300">

            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>2. Next, the site will ask you to create an account. Create an account and click next step.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="sslcertpicture2.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                    width="500" height="300">
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>3. Then, enter your domain in the text field and click next step.

            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>4. Next, select the certificate validity period. Since it’s the free version, select 90 days.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="sslcertpicture5.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                width="800" height="180">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>5. You can't choose add-ons in the free version, so leave it empty.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="postaukset\sslcertpicture3.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                width="800" height="180">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>6. Enable the toggle: </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="sslcertpicture4.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                width="800" height="180">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>7. Choose the free plan (this is only possible if you didn't select any options included in a
                paid plan).</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>8. Lastly, you need to verify the domain to ensure you own it. I used DNS (CNAME) verification as it’s
                the easiest.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="sslcertpicture6.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                width="700" height="400">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>9. Next, go to your own DNS hosting provider and add the CNAME record according to the instructions in
                the image above.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="sslcertpicture7.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                width="800" height="180">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>10. Finally, verify the domain. This can take anywhere from one minute to 48 hours depending on the
                provider.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="sslcertpicture8.PNG" alt="zerossl"
                width="700" height="400">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>11. Once the domain is verified, you can download the certificate file. The certificate needs to be added
                to
                your web host's SSL certificate section. My website runs on GitHub Pages, which automatically fetches
                the certificate from my DNS host and updates it. It took about five hours for it to start working.</p>
