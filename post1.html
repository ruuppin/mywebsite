            <p> Bucket list update! Create own website - check! 19/11/2024

                Yay! I finally managed to create my own website. This has been on my bucket list ever since my first
                HTML course
                in university, where we were encouraged to make our own pages and post our school projects on there.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, five years later, the site is up and running, available for the world to see. The hardest part was
                deciding
                on the design. I dreamed of early 2000s-style websites, full of colors and images, but ultimately
                decided to go
                for a simpler layout to ensure I would actually finish the project. The site is still a work in
                progress; I want
                to add a language switcher to toggle between English and Finnish, and a dark/bright theme switcher.
                Plus, I need
                to secure the site with HTTPS.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Initially, I wanted to host my website locally on my Raspberry Pi within my network, and also make it
                accessible
                to the world. However, for security reasons, the site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages. I still need
                to
                explore how safe it is to run a web server on my network.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                So, what will I be posting here? Iâ€™ll mainly be sharing my projects related to basic IT or cloud
                computing. This
                site will serve as a portfolio, especially useful if I ever decide to change jobs. Additionally, Iâ€™ll
                post for
                my own enjoyment whenever I have the time, with minimal stress. I doubt anyone will find this site
                unless I
                promote it.
