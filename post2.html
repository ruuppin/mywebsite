            <p>Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification Renewal
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                Last week, I renewed my Microsoft Azure Administrator certification, which is valid for one year and
                must be renewed before expiration to remain active. This was my first renewal, and I must admit it was
                challenging. The renewal process doesn't require prior preparation or practice, and it allows unlimited
                time with internet access, but the test still proved to be quite difficult.

                During the exam, I avoided directly Googling answers and relied instead on Microsoft Learn and their
                documentation, as is required in the actual certification exam. Some questions were straightforward and
                resembled those from last year’s exam, while others were very challenging, with answer options so
                similar that it was hard to pinpoint the correct one. For a few questions, I ended up guessing. I
                managed to pass with a score of about 75%.

                Although I've worked extensively with Azure over the past year, I feel I would have performed better on
                this renewal exam right after taking the initial certification when everything was fresh in my mind.
                This highlights that the exams emphasize problem-solving skills over rote memorization.

                Overall, the renewal process felt less stressful than the original certification exam, likely because
                it’s free and not proctored via camera. That said, the Azure Administrator certification remains the
                most difficult Microsoft certification I've completed so far. I’m already looking forward to next year’s
                renewal challenge!
